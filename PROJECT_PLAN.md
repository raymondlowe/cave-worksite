# Project Plan: Update melissani-cave.com

## 1. Audit Existing Content
- [ ] Review current website content in `melissani-cave.com`
- [ ] Make a list of "facts" as a stand alone markdown file  which the website has; these might be wrong or outdated. Define at the top of the file, then use, a formal syntax for facts.
- [ ] Review all files in the `research` folder for relevant information

## 2. Identify Content Gaps & Opportunities
- [ ] Compare website content with research materials, look for things that conflict with the facts found previously
- [ ] List missing or outdated topics (e.g., visitor info, history, FAQs, search performance)
- [ ] Make an erreta or error correction document

## 3. Plan Website Structure & Features
- [ ] Outline improved site structure (pages, navigation)
- [ ] Decide on new sections/features (e.g., updated FAQ, timeline, analytics, media)

## 4. Content Creation & Update
- [ ] Draft new/updated content for each page using research files:
  - [ ] Visitor information (from `Melissani Cave, Kefalonia_ The Complete Visitorâ€™s.md`)
  - [ ] FAQs (from `faq.txt`)
  - [ ] Timeline/history (from `timeline.txt`)
  - [ ] Research insights (from `briefing.txt`, `studyguide.txt`, `scira.txt`, `deepseek.txt`)
  - [ ] Analytics/SEO (from `https___www.melissani-cave.com_-Performance-on-Search-2025-07-04/`)
- [ ] Fact-check and supplement with additional web research as needed. Use Web Search for Copilot to check facts.


## 5. Website Implementation

- [ ] Add new content and features
- [ ] Optimize for SEO and accessibility
