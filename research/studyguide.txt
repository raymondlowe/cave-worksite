Answer Key
Melissani Cave is also known as Melissani Lake or the Cave of the Nymphs. It is unique for its partially collapsed roof, which allows sunlight to illuminate the underground turquoise lake, creating a magical display of colors and reflections.
The open roof of Melissani Cave was formed by a major earthquake in 1953, which caused the cave's roof to collapse. The cave itself was rediscovered in 1951 by speleologist Ioannis Petrochilos.
According to Greek mythology, the nymph Melissanthi drowned herself in the lake after her love for the god Pan was unrequited. This tragic love story led the cave to be considered a sacred site dedicated to Pan and the nymphs.
Archaeological excavations in 1962 uncovered a clay figurine of Pan and plates depicting dancing nymphs, dating back to the 3rd-4th century BC. These artifacts, now in the Argostoli Archaeological Museum, provide evidence of the cave's use as a sanctuary for ancient rituals.
The optimal time to visit Melissani Cave for the best visual experience is between 11:30 AM and 2:00 PM. During these midday hours, sunlight streams directly through the collapsed roof, intensely illuminating the turquoise water and creating spectacular effects.
The water in Melissani Lake is brackish, composed of approximately 60% seawater and 40% freshwater. This unique composition is part of a larger hydrological system where seawater enters sinkholes near Argostoli, flows underground for about 14 days, and resurfaces at Melissani.
The ticket price for Melissani Cave includes a boat ride across the underground lake. This boat tour typically lasts between 10 to 15 minutes, allowing visitors to explore both the sunlit and darker chambers of the cave.
Beyond the boat tour, guides often share mythological connections and point out rock formations and light phenomena. Boatmen sometimes enhance the experience by singing traditional cantadas, adding to the cave's mystical ambiance.
Visitors should wear comfortable, non-slip shoes due to the steep and potentially slippery tunnel leading to the lake. Swimming is strictly prohibited in Melissani Lake to protect its delicate ecosystem.
Two notable attractions near Melissani Cave are Drogarati Cave, an impressive stalactite cave often visited with a combo ticket, and the charming village of Sami, which offers tavernas and shops close to the cave.
