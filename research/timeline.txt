Detailed Timeline of Events Related to Melissani Cave
Pre-3rd/4th Century BC:

Ancient Origins of the Lake: The underground lake in Melissani Cave formed as part of a larger hydrological system where seawater enters sinkholes near Argostoli (Katavothres), flows underground for approximately 14 days, and then resurfaces at Melissani before reaching the sea. This process, involving the dissolution of limestone by groundwater (karopoiesis), carved out the intricate cave system.
Formation of Geological Features: Stalactites and stalagmites, some resembling dolphins, formed over approximately 20,000 years within the cave. The cave walls were carved and hollowed out by water eroding the rock over millennia, forming a giant islet in the middle.
Mythological Association: The legend of the nymph Melissanthi, who drowned herself in the lake due to unrequited love for the god Pan, becomes associated with the cave.
Early Sacred Site: The cave is believed to have been a sacred site dedicated to Pan and the nymphs, possibly used for ancient rituals and fertility rites, and potentially a bathing place for the goddess Artemis.
