### 1. Geological Formation and Physical Features
Melissani Cave exemplifies **coastal karst hydrology**, formed through limestone dissolution by groundwater over millennia. Key characteristics include:
- **Cenote Structure**: A 1953 earthquake collapsed the roof, creating a 40x50-meter skylight . The cave now consists of **two interconnected chambers**: one flooded and open to sunlight, the other fully enclosed .
- **Dimensions**: The cave spans **164 meters long**, with widths of 35–50 meters and heights up to **36 meters**. The lake depth varies from **10–40 meters** .
- **Hydrological Phenomenon**: The lake contains **brackish water** (60% seawater, 40% freshwater) . It forms part of a larger system where seawater enters sinkholes near Argostoli (Katavothres), flows underground for 14 days, and resurfaces at Melissani before reaching the sea .
- **Ecological Features**: Stalactites and stalagmites (some resembling dolphins) adorn the chambers, formed over 20,000 years . Eels inhabit the lake, and forest vegetation surrounds the entrance .
