### Introduction
Melissani Cave, also known as Melissani Lake or the Cave of the Nymphs, is a remarkable geological and cultural site on the island of Kefalonia in Greece, renowned for its subterranean lake and historical significance [Melissani Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissani_Cave). This report provides an in-depth analysis of the cave, addressing key queries from tourists, including details on tickets, opening times, history, transportation, and other practical information, while targeting English-speaking readers and incorporating original Greek sources for authenticity [Λιμνοσπήλαιο Μελισσάνης](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9B%CE%B9%CE%BC%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%80%CE%AE%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%BF_%CE%9C%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%83%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82). The cave, situated near the village of Karavomilos, exemplifies a karst formation resulting from the dissolution of Upper Cretaceous limestones, creating a natural wonder that has drawn visitors since its rediscovery in 1951 [Melissani Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissani_Cave). Drawing from multi-source research, this analysis synthesizes web, academic, and social media insights to offer a thorough guide, while evaluating the reliability of sources and acknowledging limitations in historical and seasonal data.

The site's appeal lies in its blend of natural beauty and mythological lore, where the underground lake's turquoise waters reflect sunlight through a collapsed roof, forming a spectacle that has been mythologized in Greek tradition as a place of worship for Pan and the nymphs [Visit Greece](https://www.visitgreece.gr/experiences/nature/melissani-cave/). This report covers essential aspects such as access, costs, and nearby attractions, ensuring visitors are well-informed for an optimal experience. However, the analysis is constrained by the variability in real-time data, such as seasonal opening hours, which may require cross-verification with official sources for accuracy [Δήμος Σάμης](https://sami.gov.gr/taxonomy/term/60). By integrating evidence from diverse references, the following sections provide a detailed, evidence-based overview to address all specified queries.

### History and Geological Features of Melissani Cave
Melissani Cave's history is deeply intertwined with geological processes and ancient mythology, making it a site of significant scientific and cultural interest [Melissani Cave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melissani_Cave). The cave was first explored in 1951 by speleontologist Ioannis Petrochilos, who discovered an ancient lamp on the central hill, indicating its use as a worship site for the god Pan, with evidence of human activity dating back to the 3rd-4th century BC [Historic Timeline](https://www.melissani-cave.com/history). This rediscovery followed a major earthquake in 1953 that caused the roof to collapse, exposing the underground lake and transforming the site into a visible natural phenomenon [Visit Greece](https://www.visitgreece.gr/experiences/nature/melissani-cave/). The collapse revealed a cenote formed through karst processes, where water erosion of Upper Cretaceous limestones created hollows, resulting in a lake measuring approximately 60 meters by 40 meters and depths ranging from 10 to 35 meters [Geosite No 25](https://kefaloniageopark.gr/en/node/302). These features highlight the cave's role as a typical karst environment in coastal carbonate aquifers, where freshwater recharge mixes with seawater intrusion [Assessment of Geological Heritage](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/12/2/55).

In Greek sources, the cave is referenced as a place of ancient rituals, with artifacts such as a clay figurine of Pan and depictions of dancing nymphs uncovered during 1962 excavations, now housed in the Archaeological Museum of Argostoli [Λιμνοσπήλαιο Μελισσάνης](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9B%CE%B9%CE%BC%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%80%CE%AE%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%BF_%CE%9C%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%83%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82). Mythologically, it is associated with the nymph Melissanthi, who reportedly drowned herself in the lake due to unrequited love for Pan, a narrative that underscores its cultural heritage [Melissani, the Cave of the Nymphs](http://greececonfidential.gr/ionian/melissani-the-cave-of-the-nymphs/). The geological structure, including stalactites and an islet within the lake, has been studied as part of Kefalonia's broader karst network, emphasizing its formation through mechanical and chemical dissolution [Γεωπάρκο Κεφαλονιάς](https://kefaloniageopark.gr/en/node/302). However, the reliability of these accounts varies; while Wikipedia and academic papers provide verifiable data, social media and tourist sites may exaggerate mythological elements, potentially introducing inaccuracies [Melissani Cave Reviews](https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g8281993-d1142674-Reviews-Melissani_Cave-Karavomylos_Sami_Kefalonia_Ionian_Islands.html). Limitations in the research include the lack of precise dating for some artifacts, which relies on indirect evidence from excavations, necessitating further archaeological validation.

The cave's ecological and aesthetic value is enhanced by its biodiversity, with the lake supporting a mix of freshwater and marine species, though human visitation has introduced environmental pressures [Assessment of Geological Heritage](https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3263/12/2/55). In original Greek texts, such as those from the Εθνική Βιβλιοθήκη, the site is described as a "λιμνοσπήλαιο" (lacustrine cave), emphasizing its unique hydrological features and the interplay of light and water that creates the vivid blue hues [Λιμνοσπήλαιο Μελισσάνης](https://el.wikipedia.org/wiki/%CE%9B%CE%B9%CE%BC%CE%BD%CE%BF%CF%83%CF%80%CE%AE%CE%BB%CE%B1%CE%B9%CE%BF_%CE%9C%CE%B5%CE%BB%CE%B9%CF%83%CF%83%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%B7%CF%82). This integration of geological science and cultural narrative positions Melissani as a multifaceted destination, though ongoing tourism development risks altering its natural state, as noted in recent environmental assessments [Γεωπάρκο Κεφαλονιάς](https://kefaloniageopark.gr/en/node/302).
